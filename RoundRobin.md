## Motivation 

This process prevents working on controversial items lacking consensus, as it can lead to unproductive arguments, frustration, and further energy expenditure from our team members. Early detection of these tendencies is crucial to avoid wasting time and resources.

## Abstract 

At times, certain items on the relevance realization board (RR board) may be challenging for the team leader to evaluate. In such cases, the team leader may choose to initiate a Round Robin discussion. During this discussion, relevant team members collaborate to reach a consensus on the item's future.

## Process

1. Item appeared in the triage column in the project.
2. Team leader cannot evaulate the item
3. create an item in the round robin project board with a proper desciption - this will be a candidate for a discussion
4. On the weekly team meeting in the first 10 minutes team leader brings up the canditates and the team decides if the item is worth to discuss or not. At this moment there is no time for the broader argument, just trial the worthiness. 
5. According to the result of the votes the Team Leader can make a desision and act accordingly in the RR board.
6. If the decision is still not clear then the Coordinator schedules a meeting for that and invite everyone who is relevant or had an oppinion.   
7. On the meeting the topic discussed until the Teamleader can make the decision what to do with the item. After that the team leader act accordingly. 



If an item appears in the triage column of the project board, the team leader may find it challenging to evaluate without further information.
In this case, the team leader or coordinator creates an item with a proper description on the round robin project board, making it a candidate for discussion.
During the weekly team meeting, the team leader brings up the candidates and the team decides whether the item is worth discussing. At this stage, there is no time for extended debate; only the worthiness of the item is considered.
Based on the result of the votes, the team leader makes a decision and acts accordingly on the RR board.
If the decision is not clear, the coordinator schedules a meeting and invites relevant team members or those who are already involved in the issue.
During the meeting, the topic is discussed until the team leader can make a decision on what to do with the item. After that, the team leader takes appropriate action. Like moving item to Will Do status, or not not or Minefield.
